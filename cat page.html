<h2>INTRODUCTION OF CAT</h2>
       <p> It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. </p>
      <p>The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early 1980s, it was about seven years</p>

        <h2>Cat Loves to do </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cat Naps</strong></li>
<img src="\images\sleepy cat.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="A cute sleepy cat." >
<p>It's no secret that cats love to sleep. In fact, the average kitty sleeps for a whopping 12 to 16 hours per day! Because cats are nocturnal creatures, they snooze most of the day awayand who can blame them? Everyone loves a nice, long nap in a cozy, comfy spot.
Keep in mind, kittens and senior cats will spend more time sleeping than, say, an adolescent cat.</p> 
          <li><strong>Cats Grooming</strong></li>
<p>It keeps them clean. Not only does grooming help cats remove dirt and grime from their coats, but it prevents predators and prey from detecting them. </p>
<p>It keeps their skin and coat healthy. Regular grooming disperses the oils naturally produced by a cat's skin and fur, keeping her coat healthy, shiny, and hydrated.</p>
<p>It makes them feel relaxed. There's nothing more relaxing than a massage, right? Well, cats feel the same way! Rather than visiting a masseuse, they simply groom themselves to reduce stress and calm down.</p>
<p>It helps them bond with other kitties. Cats groom each other—and their humans!—to develop and strengthen their bond. You'll often see cats grooming each other.</p>

          <li><strong>Cat loves Scratching nad clawing</strong></li>
<p>One of the cats' basic instincts is to sharpen their claws by scratching and clawing different surfaces. They also happen to get a ton of joy from it, too.

In addition to sharpening their claws, scratching can help relax and rejuvenate cats. Think of it as the human equivalent to a nice, long stretch when your muscles are tired or achy.</p>

        <h3>Cats senses</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Vision</strong></li>
<img src="\images\look.jpg"width="250" height="250">
<p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration. At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.</p>
          <li><strong>Hearing</strong></li>
<img src="\images\hear.jpg"width="250" height="250">
<p>The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.</p>
          <li><strong>Whiskers</strong></li>
<img src="\images\whick.jpg"width="250" height="250">
<p>To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.</p>
